                            <h4 class="terms__heading">16. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h4>
                            <h4 class="terms__heading">16.1 Generally</h4>
                            <p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and ANDAMANMARKET.SHOP in the
                                most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section
                                16.2, you and ANDAMANMARKET.SHOP agree that every dispute arising in connection
                                with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less
                                formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of
                                a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be
                                subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages
                                and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes
                                all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether
                                based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
                                theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination
                                of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU
                                AND ANDAMANMARKET.SHOP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
                                PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

                            <h4 class="terms__heading">16.2 Exceptions</h4>
                            <p>Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to
                                waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an
                                individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action
                                through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is
                                available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration;
                                or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property
                                infringement claim.</p>

                            <h4 class="terms__heading">16.3. Notice of Arbitration; Process</h4>
                            <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the
                                dispute to the other party by letter or, only if that other party has not
                                provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of
                                Arbitration”). </p>

                            <h4 class="terms__heading">16.4 No Class Actions</h4>
                            <p>YOU AND ANDAMANMARKET.SHOP AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
                                ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER
                                IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you
                                and ANDAMANMARKET.SHOP agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more
                                than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
                                representative or class proceeding.</p>

                            <h4 class="terms__heading">16.5 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</h4>
                            <p>If ANDAMANMARKET.SHOP makes any future change to this arbitration provision,
                                other than a change to ANDAMANMARKET.SHOP’s address for Notice of Arbitration,
                                you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the
                                change to ANDAMANMARKET.SHOP’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case
                                your account with ANDAMANMARKET.SHOP will be immediately terminated and this
                                arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you
                                rejected will survive.</p>

                            <h4 class="terms__heading">17. General Terms</h4>
                            <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly
                                incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive
                                understanding and agreement between you and ANDAMANMARKET.SHOP regarding your
                                use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights
                                under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,
                                without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without
                                notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not
                                affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a
                                waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these
                                Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the
                                provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only
                                and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout
                                these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited
                                to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
                                unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the
                                remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p>
